NAME
    Log::Dispatch::Config - Log4j for Perl

SYNOPSIS
      use Log::Dispatch::Config;
      Log::Dispatch::Config->configure('/path/to/config');

      my $dispatcher = Log::Dispatch->instance;

DESCRIPTION
    Log::Dispatch::Config provides a way to configure Log::Dispatch with
    configulation file (in AppConfig format). I mean, this is log4j for Perl,
    not with all API compatibility though.

METHOD
    This module has one class method `configure' which parses config file and
    declares `instance' method in Log::Dispatch namespace. So what you should
    do is call `configure' method once in somewhere (like `startup.pl' in
    mod_perl), then you can get configured dispatcher instance via
    `Log::Dispatch->instance'.

CONFIGURATION
    Here is an example of the config file:

      dispatchers = file screen

      file.class = Log::Dispatch::File
      file.min_level = debug
      file.filename = /path/to/log
      file.mode = append
      file.format = [%d] [%p] %m at %F line %L%n

      screen.class = Log::Dispatch::Screen
      screen.min_level = info
      screen.stderr = 1
      screen.format = %m

    Config file is parsed with AppConfig module, see the AppConfig manpage
    when you face configuration parsing error.

  GLOBAL PARAMETERS

    dispatchers
          dispatchers = file screen

        `dispatchers' defines logger names, which will be splitted by spaces.
        If this parameter is unset, no logging is done.

    format
          format = [%d] [%p] %m at %F line %L%n
          format = [${datetime}] [${prioity}] ${message} at ${filename} line ${line}\n

        `format' defines log format. `%X' style and `${XXX}' style are both
        supported. Possible conversions format are

          %d ${datetime}        datetime string
          %p ${priority}        priority (debug, indo, warn ...)
          %m ${message}         message string
          %F ${filename}        filename
          %L ${line}            line number
          %P ${package}         package
          %n                    newline (\n)

        `format' defined here would apply to all the log messages to
        dispatchers. This parameter is optional.

  PARAMETERS FOR EACH DISPATCHER

    Parameters for each dispatcher should be prefixed with "name.", where
    "name" is the name of each one, defined in global `dispatchers' parameter.

    class
          screen.class = Log::Dispatch::Screen

        `class' defines class name of Log::Dispatch subclasses. This parameter
        is essential.

    format
          screen.format = -- %m --

        `format' defines log format which would be applied only to the
        dispatcher. Note that if you define global `format' also, `%m' is
        double formated (first global one, next each dispatcher one). This
        parameter is optional.

    (others)
          screen.min_level = info
          screen.stderr = 1

        Other parameters would be passed to the each dispatcher construction.
        See Log::Dispatch::* manpage for the details.

SINGLETON
    Declared `instance' method would make `Log::Dispatch' class singleton, so
    multiple calls of `instance' will all result in returning same object.

      my $one = Log::Dispatch->instance;
      my $two = Log::Dispatch->instance; # same as $one

    See GoF Design Pattern book for Singleton Pattern.

    But in practice, in persistent environment like mod_perl, Singleton
    instance is not so useful. Log::Dispatch::Config defines `instance' method
    so that the object reloads itself when configuration file is modified
    since its last object creation time.

TODO
    *   LogLevel configuration depending on caller package like log4j?
